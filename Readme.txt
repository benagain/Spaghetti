Scenario
The in-house developer/chef has made a start on the restaurant's website. Unfortunately he was unable to complete the job after being told to 'do some real work' by the owner. 
They are now looking for someone to finish the job...

The only payment type available is Debit Card. 
	** Please extend this to allow the Credit Card option to be selected.

Currently the menu shows everything that is available. 
	** Please separate the split this into a list for each course type and label appropriately e.g. 'Starters'.

Currently all orders go through at the same price. 
	** Please correct this so it uses the price of the item chosen.

The 'Payment OK' message appears on standalone page with only the header menu for navigation. 
	** Please adjust this to improve the user experience.

Further development:
	** Allow the user to select multiple items from the menu and be charged accordingly.
	** Add some tests for the payment gateway (you will probably need to extend the implementation of the gateway in order to do so). 
	** You may also notice some of the existing tests are failing. Consider how you might resolve this situation.
